description: |
    both songs written by Jake Taylor in the fall of 2015
    originally recorded alone with sparse instrumentation
    and featured on the bootlegs debut CD-R release
    "velveteen robot" (January 2016)
    a garage rock mini-opera
    about suburban existential dread

    these songs have been revisited
    with assistance from friends and family
    new threads for the modern age
