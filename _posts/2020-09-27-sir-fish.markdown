  The Creature from the Black Lagoon
  The Incredible Mr. Limpet
  Cyrano de Bergerac
  & a bad pun

  Mix them all & you get Sir Fish, an excursion by The Muties into the Realms of Aqua-Rock chronicling the adventures of the titular hero.

  Our maiden voyage into these waters was disastrously botched due to a tragic technical blunder. Only 7 rough mixes survived (tracks 6-12).

  We rallied our ambitions & a second attempt was made. Sadly, this vessel also sank before long, leaving 5 songs salvageable (tracks 1-5).

  As such, the story of Sir Fish remains incomplete. Some songs appear twice, others not at all (!).

  But who knows what the fish's future may hold or what grime-encrusted treasures may float up from the murky depths.

  (Download comes with a bonus track!)
